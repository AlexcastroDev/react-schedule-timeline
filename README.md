# Schedule Timeline

I recommend not using this code yet, I'm migrating this project with some dependencies from company private project to a open source version.

I take long time to find some timeline cool and free, but no results.

My goal is to build something like this: https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/examples/bigdataset-tree/
